# AllProjects
1.) Click on a language folder to find any and all projects I've completed and coded in said language(s)!

2.) All Projects have a name that includes the complete code of the project.

3.) Since some projects have multiple languages, you can find split up code in the designated folders.

4.) I've included folders labeled "Highlights" which has code/scripts I've created that I am particualry proud of. I have added additioanl comments expalining sections of code to files in these folders.
