Basic Info:

This is the first website I ever created! I learned a lot about web development in the creation of this website, and am particulary proud of the scripts I wrote in Javascript. Check out the website itself at "https://marashen.github.io/AstronomicalAstronomyLiveWS/".

Guide:

- The Full Website folder contains the complete website code with all 3 languages in one file.

- The other folders contain the langauge designated by the name.

- Check out pieces of code I highlighted in the language specific folders for more detailed comments!
